## Development server

To run the development server, use the command `ng serve`. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` in your browser. The application will automatically reload if you make any changes to the source files.

## Code scaffolding

You can generate various components using Angular CLI commands. For example, to generate a new component, use `ng generate component component-name`. You can also generate directives, pipes, services, classes, guards, interfaces, enums, or modules.

## Build

To build the project, use the command `ng build`. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

To run unit tests, execute the command `ng test`. This runs the tests using Karma test runner.

## Running end-to-end tests

To run end-to-end tests, use the command `ng e2e`. This executes the tests using a platform of your choice. However, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

For more information and help on using the Angular CLI, you can use the command `ng help` or refer to the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
